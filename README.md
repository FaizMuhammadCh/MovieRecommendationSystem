# MovieRecommendationSystem
The code uses the Movielens dataset to recommend Top-N movies to users and groups of users.

Both user and group recommendation scripts output a list of Top-N movies based on the User-based Collaborative Filtering method. 

The group recommendation script arbitrarily chooses 3 users from the dataset and recommend top 20 movies. Two aggregation approaches have been used in the script: Average Aggregation and Least Misery.
